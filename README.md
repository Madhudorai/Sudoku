# Sudoku 
The complete.py file on being run, generates a 9x9 sudoku puzzle after asking for user input for difficulty. It also prints the solution
The solver multiple sols.py file, I hope will help fellow students who are starting this project, to verify if their sudoku has only 1 solution. It can print the number of solutions and the solutions themselves

The entire code is written in Python
